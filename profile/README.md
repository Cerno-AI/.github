# Cerno

**Agentic Infrastructure for Research & Productivity. Built for Transparency. Designed to Stay Local.**

Cerno is an open-source initiative creating local-first tools for advanced workflows powered by LLMs and autonomous agents.

Our mission: Empower developers, researchers, and analysts with **transparent**, **customizable**, and **vendor-agnostic** tools that run on your terms, right from your machine.



##  Flagship Projects

### 1. [**Cerno: Agentic Deep Research**](https://github.com/cerno-ai/Cerno-Agentic-Local-Deep-Research)  
A local-first workspace for deep, multi-step research with autonomous agents. Plan, execute, audit — step-by-step.



### 2. **Cerno Core** _(in development)_  
An autonomous AI productivity assistant designed to help manage:

- **Email & Calendar** (Gmail, Google Calendar, Outlook)
- **Task Planning & Notes**
- **Code Automation**
- **Data Analysis & File Tools**

Planned integrations include:

- ✅ **Todoist**
- ✅ **Calendly**

Built with a local-first philosophy and extensibility at its core.



##  More Tools Coming Soon

We’re building a broader ecosystem around Cerno’s agentic core:
